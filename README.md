This is the code repository for [Python Digital Forensics Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/python-digital-forensics-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783987467), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives and shows no sign of stopping. Now, more than ever, it is paramount that an investigator develops programming expertise to deal with increasingly large datasets.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

This is the code bundle for the book, Python Digital Forensics Cookbook, published by Packt.

All the code files are arracnged in the folder of respective chapter.

The code will look like the following:
```
def hello_world():
    print(“Hello World!”)
hello_world()
```

In order to follow along with and execute the recipes within this cookbook, use a computer with an Internet connection and the latest Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 installations. Recipes may require additional third-party libraries to be installed; instructions for doing that are provided in the recipe. For ease of development and implementation of these recipes, it is recommended that you set up and configure an Ubuntu virtual machine for development. These recipes, unless otherwise noted, were built and tested within an Ubuntu 16.04 environment with both Python 2.7 and 3.5. Several recipes will require the use of a Windows operating system, as many forensic tools operate onlyon this platform.
